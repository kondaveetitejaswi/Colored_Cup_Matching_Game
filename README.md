**Colored Cup Matching Game**

The Colored Cup Matching Game is an interactive puzzle-based desktop application developed using Python's Tkinter library. The objective of the game is to arrange a set of colored cups in the correct order by dragging and dropping them into their respective positions. Each cup consists of two parts—a frustum and a base—making the interaction visually engaging and realistic.

The game is designed to simulate a state search problem, where each unique arrangement of cups represents a distinct state in the search space. To determine the target drop position, the system uses the Manhattan distance metric, enhancing the precision of user interactions.

With clean drag-and-drop mechanics, intelligent snapping based on overlap thresholds, and smooth animations, the game combines principles from game design, graph search, and human-computer interaction. This project not only showcases GUI programming skills but also provides a fun and challenging way to visualize problem-solving strategies.
